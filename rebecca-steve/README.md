**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
I want users to be able to load my articles from an external source so that they do not need to keep all of the articles on their local machine.
I want developers to understand the order of execution of my code so that they can better understand its functionality and optimize its efficiency and maintainability.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The best route would be to hire a programer to build it for you. But if you can't do that. Get the starter code from Allie. Get the url of the blog articles.  Set up their HTML and CSS using SMACSS.  Link the Jquery, handlebars, and Ajax librarys in the HTML.  Call the first Article.fetch function at the end of the index.html. Set up a the Article.fetch function to check local storage for the s]articles prior to loading them from the server or other femote storage.  Render the articles on the page.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used SMACSS to design the HTML and CSS.  We used the Jquery, handlebar, and Ajax librarys. We used Jquery to access and ipcdate the DOM and handlebars to maintain the templates for the articles.  We used Ajax to access the server or eemote storage where the blog articles were stored.

## Credits and Collaborations
We got a lot of help from the team of Beverly and Josh as well as the TAs.  We used MDN and the Jquery cheatsheet at https://oscarotero.com/jquery/ .  Finally, Austin help me find the problem with my local storage view.
